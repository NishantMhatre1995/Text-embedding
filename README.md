# Text-embedding

The main aim was to learn NLP techniques. After this I will build classification model.

In this project, a collection of customer reviews from Amazon were processed using several NLP approaches. The removal of stopwords, stopphrases, urls, stemming and numerals has been applied during the preprocessing of documents. Then, each word was lemmatized and POS-tagged. The generated texts have been represented using a variety of techniques, including Tf-Idf, Word2Vec, and Bag of Word representations. Here I learn basics of NLP with how can we transform the text data to numerical format so that we can apply machine learning algorithm.
